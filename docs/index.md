# Introduction

**This sample showcases the mkdocs static site creator, using the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.**

Material for Mkdocs has an attractive and accessible template that works well across a range of devices. (If you are on a computer, you can resize the browser to see this in action.) 

The Material template has a high-standard of web-accessibility built-in. To see any example, try using the tab key to navigate this site using your keyboard.   

This static site framework also provides an extensive range of additional features for presenting content and customising the site's appearance. Some examples of these are provided on the next few pages.

## Writing content

Content can be easily added using standard [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 

Markdown supports any formatting you would expect to see on a web-page. The static site-generator will then automatically style these elements to display them. 

The static site generator will also use the headings and sub-headings you use to automatically create the website's page navigation and internal links. (These can be further adjusted in the mkdocs.yml file where necessary.)


## Examples of basic content

### Basic markup

Markdown supports adding *italic* and **bold** text.

New paragraphs are created by simply leaving a blank line.

### Lists

Here is an example of a basic unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

And here is an ordered list.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

### Blocks

Here is a simple block quote:

> The only difference between a problem and a solution is that people understand the solution. - Charles F. Kettering, 1876 - 1958

And below is a very basic code block. As you'll see on a later page, Mkdocs offers additional support for language specific code-highlight and other advanced features:

```
for i in array:
    print(i+1)
```
